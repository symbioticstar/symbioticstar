#### 💭 Opinions & Predictions

*   [2021 ~ Present] 🦀 Rust: Taking a wait-and-see approach. It still feels far from mature to me.
*   [2024 ~ 2025] 🚫 JS/TS: Feeling negative. They are becoming stale and irritating.
*   [2026 (Future)] ✨ TypeScript: *"Delicious."* TypeScript is nice again. (Just wait for it)
