### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

This is symbioticstar, they usually called me *ss* previously. I've not got a constant nickname, so you can call me what you like.

Currently working for RDS group in Alibaba Cloud.

Preferred languages are Typescript and C++. At work I have no choice to write Java, Python and Go.
